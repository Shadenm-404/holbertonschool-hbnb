# holbertonschool-hbnb Project

HBnB Evolution is a technical documentation project focused on designing the architecture of a simplified Airbnb-like application.  
The objective of this project is to define a clear system structure using a layered architecture approach before moving into the implementation phase.  
This documentation serves as a foundational blueprint that explains how different components of the system are organized and how they interact with each other.  
Emphasis is placed on UML modeling, clean architectural design, and separation of concerns.

## High-Level Package Diagram

The diagram below presents the **High-Level Package Diagram** for the HBnB Evolution application.  
It illustrates the three main layers of the system: **Presentation Layer**, **Business Logic Layer**, and **Persistence Layer**, and demonstrates how these layers communicate through the **Facade Pattern**.  
This diagram provides a high-level architectural overview without including implementation or database-specific details.
