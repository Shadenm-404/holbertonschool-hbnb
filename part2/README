HBnB – Part 2: Business Logic Layer

This part of the HBnB project implements the Business Logic Layer (BL) and exposes it through RESTful API endpoints, following the architecture defined in Part 1.
The project applies the Facade Design Pattern to centralize business operations and enforce separation between the API, Business Logic, and Repository layers.
An in-memory persistence mechanism is used to manage entities, validation, and relationships.

Business Logic Responsibilities

Validate input data before creation/update

Enforce business rules and constraints

Coordinate between the API and repository layers

Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered design:

API Layer: handles HTTP requests and responses

Business Logic Layer: validation, rules, relationships

Repository Layer: abstracts data storage (in-memory)

Project Objectives

Organize a clean modular project structure

Implement core entities and constraints

Build RESTful endpoints using Flask-RESTX
